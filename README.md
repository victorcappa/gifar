<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

 
<p align="left">
 <p> 
Simple proof of concept developed to see the results of connecting Giphy API to an AR experience.

 </p>
 
  <h3>Challenges</h3
<p>
  The biggest challenge here was to use gifs with the A-Frame framework.
  Fortunately, there is a library called <a href="https://github.com/mayognaise/aframe-gif-shader" target="_blank">mayognaise</a>
  that makes everything as easy as adding a material to the gif entity.
</p>

<h3>Functionalities</h3>
 
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Add GIFs button</b> - It shows a UI list with the top GIFs at the current time.</li>
    <li><b>GIF list and search</b> - The user can search and select a GIF, which will be added as the material of a box entity.</li>
    <li><b>Remove last GIF button</b> - It removes the last added GIF. The button can be pressed until there are no GIFs in the scene.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
